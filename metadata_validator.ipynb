    "    - define input folder, reads in .json, _*.json and dataImportOrder.txt into an accessible object\n",

    "    - class Loads bundled json and also splits yamls from bundled json into accessible splits\n",

    "To handle a scenario where your `bundled.json` file contains a `_definitions.yaml` file, and some of the YAML schemas in the `bundled.json` link to `_definitions.yaml` for common definitions, you need to ensure that your JSON Schema validator can resolve these references correctly. Here’s how you can achieve this using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Validate `metadata.json` Against a Schema with External Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Parse YAML Files**: Load and parse the `_definitions.yaml` and other YAML schemas from the `bundled.json` file.\n",
    "2. **Resolve References**: Ensure that references to definitions in `_definitions.yaml` are correctly resolved.\n",
    "3. **Validate the JSON Data**: Use a JSON Schema validator to validate the `metadata.json` file against the resolved schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step guide using Python, `jsonschema`, and `pyyaml` libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install jsonschema pyyaml\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and Parse YAML Files**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import yaml\n",
    "   import json\n",
    "   from jsonschema import validate, RefResolver, ValidationError\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Load the bundled JSON file containing multiple YAML schemas\n",
    "   with open('bundled.json', 'r') as bundled_file:\n",
    "       bundled_schemas = json.load(bundled_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Extract and parse the _definitions.yaml file\n",
    "   definitions_yaml = bundled_schemas['_definitions.yaml']\n",
    "   definitions_schema = yaml.safe_load(definitions_yaml)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Extract and parse the specific schema that references _definitions.yaml\n",
    "   specific_schema_yaml = bundled_schemas['specific_schema_key']  # Replace with the actual key\n",
    "   specific_schema = yaml.safe_load(specific_schema_yaml)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resolve References**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Create a resolver that includes the definitions\n",
    "   class CustomRefResolver(RefResolver):\n",
    "       def resolve_remote(self, uri):\n",
    "           if uri == 'definitions.yaml':\n",
    "               return definitions_schema\n",
    "           return super().resolve_remote(uri)\n",
    "\n",
    "   resolver = CustomRefResolver.from_schema(specific_schema)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validate the JSON Data**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Load the metadata JSON file\n",
    "   with open('metadata.json', 'r') as json_file:\n",
    "       metadata = json.load(json_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Validate the metadata against the specific schema with resolved references\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       validate(instance=metadata, schema=specific_schema, resolver=resolver)\n",
    "       print(\"Validation successful!\")\n",
    "   except ValidationError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Validation error: {e.message}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Parse YAML Files**:\n",
    "   - Load the `bundled.json` file, which contains multiple YAML schemas.\n",
    "   - Extract and parse the `_definitions.yaml` file and the specific schema that references it using `yaml.safe_load`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resolve References**:\n",
    "   - Create a custom `RefResolver` class that overrides the `resolve_remote` method to return the parsed `_definitions.yaml` schema when the reference URI matches.\n",
    "   - Instantiate the custom resolver with the specific schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validate the JSON Data**:\n",
    "   - Load the `metadata.json` file.\n",
    "   - Use the `validate` function from the `jsonschema` library to validate the `metadata.json` data against the specific schema, using the custom resolver to handle references.\n",
    "\n",

    "By following these steps, you can ensure that your `metadata.json` file is validated against the correct schema, even if it relies on external definitions in `_definitions.yaml`. This approach leverages Python's `jsonschema` library and custom reference resolution to handle complex schema validation scenarios.\n"
