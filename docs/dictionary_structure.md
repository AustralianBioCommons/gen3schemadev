## Required entities

All dictionaries must have the following schemas as part of the dictionary structure:
- Program
- Project
- Core Metadata Collection

While properties may be edited within these, the `dbgap` associated fields on the projects cannot be removed.

In addition, all data files need to be linked to the `core_metadata_collection`.
