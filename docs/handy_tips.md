# Handy Tips

- If you need to use special characters like `: - ` in the descriptors or patterns, they must be in quotes and potentially double-escaped.
- When using a regex pattern for string validation, ensure you include an example in the `valid` and `invalid` folders so that you can test it is behaving as expected when you validate the dictionary.
- Don't name your variables or properties that are already system properties e.g. `id`, `type`, `submitter_id`, `state`, `created_datetime`, `updated_datetime`, `file_state`, `error_type`, etc
